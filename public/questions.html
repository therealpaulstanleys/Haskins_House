        <h2>Do you buy used records?</h2>

        <h2>Do you offer trade-ins for records?</h2>
        <p>Yes, we do! If you have records you'd like to trade, bring them in. We'll assess their value and you can use that towards purchasing other records in our store. It's a great way to refresh your collection!</p>
        
        <h2>Do you offer international shipping?</h2>
        <p>We ship to select countries. Please contact us for more information about specific destinations and shipping rates.</p>

        <h2>What condition are your records in?</h2>
        <p>We pride ourselves on offering high-quality records. All our used records are carefully graded and cleaned before being put on sale. We're always happy to provide detailed condition reports upon request.</p>
        
        <h2>Do you guys like cookies?</h2>
        <p>We LOVE cookies! In fact, if you bring in some homemade cookies with your records, we might just be extra generous with our offer. (Just kidding... maybe.) But seriously, who doesn't love a good cookie while browsing through vinyl?</p>
